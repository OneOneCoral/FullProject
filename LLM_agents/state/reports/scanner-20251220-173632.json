    "notes": [
      "The repository appears to be structured with many test and versioned subfolders, primarily under the 'Pygame\\PygameTest' path, each containing a main.py file that serves as an entry point for different iterations or experiments of the project.",
      "Entrypoints are detected as files that initialize Pygame, create a window, instantiate game objects like the Player, Camera, and World, and run a main loop handling events and rendering.",
      "The agents/ and Agent/ directories appear to contain meta-programming and code automation utilities, rather than being part of the main game logic or a user-facing entrypoint.",
      "There are a number of support modules (e.g., camera.py, player.py, world.py, rendering.py, profiler.py, config.py, input_handler.py, mini_map.py) that are shared across multiple versions, but none of them serve as entrypoints independently.",
      "Recommended edits to entrypoints should be accompanied by edits to supporting modules if major changes to game logic, controls, or rendering are required.",
      "Older/other iterations (such as 20251020, 20251021, 20251024) each have their own main.py with support modules in the same directory; typically only one would be the 'current' or preferred entrypoint.",
      "The root-level script 20251220_agent_launcher.py and all files under agents/ are likely non-game-facing and serve as tooling or orchestration for agent-driven development or automation.",
      "If unifying or streamlining, focus enhancements or major refactoring on the latest/main version's entrypoint and its associated support modules."
